#### Maintaining CSS SMACCSS
* Normalize.css
  * "normalizes" our css across browsers 

* SMACSS
  * Modular CSS - why use it?
  * Modules: base, layout, module, state, and theme
  * [SMACCS vs BEM](https://www.sitepoint.com/bem-smacss-advice-from-developers/)

#### Responsive Web Design
* RWD vs. AWD
  * Why responsive development?
    * Larger coverage area
    * Multiple device support
    * Think: spandex
    * Example: [The Outline](https://theoutline.com/)
  * Why adaptive development?
    * AKA dynamic serving
    * Server determines what HTML, CSS, etc assets a device will receive
    * Accessibility, not everyone has the latest tech that can render large responsive websites
    * Think: wardrobe of interchangable clothes of all shapes and sizes
    * Example: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)
      * Preview of the dev tools Network tab!
* How to implement RWD
  * Viewports
    * Using the meta viewport tag and it’s width and scale options
  * Media Queries
    * Using min-width media query for mobile first design and development
    * Mobile first design
      * Design our CSS so the default styles are for mobile, and the queries are for desktop
* Flexible Media
  * Using `max-width` for scalable images
* Use an icon font
