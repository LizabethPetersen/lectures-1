# Code 301: Intermediate Software Development

Welcome to Code 301! This class builds on your fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, git, and general web development, to prepare you for the deep dive of any Code 401 class.

# Introduction

We are going to learn about many different topics of web development. The overall structure of the course is based on a common design pattern for web applications: Model-View-Controller (MVC). The course has three modules; in each we'll explore one aspect of this pattern and other related topics.

The general course schedule is:

Full Time  | Topic
-----------|---------------
Module 1     | The View
Module 2     | The Model
Module 3     | The Controller
Module 4     | Project Week

## Class Resources

We will have our own GitHub Organization to manage all of our repositories. All lecture notes and information will be found in this repo, under that day's directory. Your daily labs will have their own repo within this organization.

## Slides from class

Any slides used during class will be sent out via Ryver after class. Lecture outlines and notes will be in each lecture's directory's README.

## Assignments

Lab-time code assignments follow each class time. Find these assignments in their own repo.

- Instructions for completing assignments can be found in their repo's README files. 
- Assignments will be submitted using a professional-grade [git-flow](GIT_FLOW.md) aka lots and lots of PR's.
